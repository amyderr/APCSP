    <p class = "p">My Apple AirTag Presentation: </p>
    <img src = "airtagpres.png">	
    <p>This project was for AP Computer Science Principles. The presentation presents a tech innovation that uses data and affects the world in a positive way. I chose Apple AirTags as my tech innovation. To complete the project, I had to figure out how data was being used, transformed, and stored in my innovation. I learned that they're so many tech innovations every year that change the world in a positive way. 
    <p class = "p">My Nuclear Power Presentation: </p>
    <img src = "nuclear.png">
    <p>This project was for Honors Chemistry. The presentation presents the con side to if the US should explore nuclear power more. This was a group presentation, so to complete the project, I had to answer a few questions, giving some background information. From the project, I learned that nuclear power has the highest energy capacity factor of any other energy source.
